- 1 - Blocking desctop app. Timing manager. You will set up time you want to spend on some task, for example, minimum 3h of Udacity in Google Chrome browser per day, this app will look for completion of this task, and if you try to open something unnecessesry, from the list of blocked apps, it will close them untill you complete your goal. Maybe it will calculate time needed and will allow you to open blocked apps but only until you still have time for planned work, for example, you will set up wake up time at 8am, bad time at 12pm, and you have 3h planned time. So program will let you do whatever you want untill 9pm, and after it will start blocking everything. Plus it can watch you goals, and if you failed one day you will have to start next with necessary work, or reduced free gap.
